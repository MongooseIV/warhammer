The objective is to score points.
There are two teams: the flamethrowers and the meltaguns. During each round the flamethrowers have d6 chances to score (i.e. an average of 7/2 = 3½ chances), 
while the meltaguns have four chances. Therefore the highest possible score per round is ten – six by flamethrowers and four by meltaguns.
During each round there are either one (if the flamethrowers are playing) or two (if the meltaguns are playing) roll(s) of the dice for each player. 
Both players have a roll known as wound, the meltaguns also have a roll called hit.
The flamethrowers score if they roll three or higher. The meltaguns score if they roll four or higher on their hit roll and two or higher on their wound roll.
Report the average score, out of ten, per round.

There are three cases to study:
Case I – As above, i.e. base case
Case II – Base case, except that if the meltagun rolls a one on their hit roll they get another chance to score. This applies only to the original hit roll.
Case III – Base case, except that if either player rolls a one on their wound roll they get another chance to score. This applies only to the original wound roll.
All cases are evaluated both by the monte carlo method and analytically.

Potential upgrade: not all scores have the same level of damage.
